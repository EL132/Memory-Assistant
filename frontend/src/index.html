            After <span class="colored-word">countless</span> hours of technical interview preparation, we found ourselves
            <span class="colored-word">unable to remember</span> specific shortcuts, memorization techniques, and other concepts.
              As such, we decided to not leave these <span class="colored-word">gaps in our knowledge</span> up to combing through
               our seemingly endless notes and instead build a <span class="colored-word">personalized assistant</span>
                tailored for our notes.
